    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Family & friends</h1>
      <p>I'm 44 years old and married since 2013 to Jidske. We have a 2 year old daughter,
        Billie. We spend a lot of time together with our family and friends. We
        enjoy hosting dinner parties, going on walks, go to wine tastings, etc.
        We like to enjoy the good things that life has to offer!</p>

    <h2>Lier</h2>
    <p>I'm originally from Kruibeke in Oost-Vlaanderen, but I'm living
      in Lier since 2011. Lier is a medieval city in the neighbourhood of Antwerp and life
      is good there. All the shops you need are just around the corner and nature
      is available everywhere. There are also plenty of caf√©s and restaurants: it's
      not a coincidence that Lier is called 'Lierke Plezierke'.
      </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>When I'm not working or playing with my daughter, you can find me on the
    tennis courts of TC Emblem. Next to tennis, I like to hike, read, watch Netflix,
    listen to music, try to do some urban sketching or just relax with a glass of wine. </p>
