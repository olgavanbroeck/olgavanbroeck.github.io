    <h1>Design Thinking</h1>
    <p>During my job as a UX (User Experience) Consultant, I often worked with
    the Design Thinking methodology. Design Thinking is an iterative process
    that puts emphasis on the user and can therefor easily be used in an
    agile environment. </p>
    <h2>What is Design Thinking?</h1>
      <p>Design thinking is a methodology that you can use to
        understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create
        innovative solutions to generally any kind of problem. The process involves
        five phases:Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.</p>

    <h2>Why is Design Thinking important?</h1>
      <p>In user experience design, it’s crucial to develop and refine skills to
        understand and address rapid changes in users’ environments and behaviors.
        The world has become increasingly interconnected and complex. And it's
        to solve these complex problems that they started applying the design thinking
        process to all fields where users need to benefit from human-centered solutions.
        Of all design processes, design thinking is almost certainly the best for
        “thinking outside the box”.
        Design thinking is used by large companies such as Google, Apple and Airbnb.
        With design thinking, you have the freedom to generate ground-breaking solutions.
        By applying a collection of hands-on methods the method helps find
        innovative answers.</p>
    <h2>The five stages of Design Thinking</h2>
    <div class="stages">
    <ol>
      <li>Empathize</li>
      <p>In this phase, you gain an empathetic understanding of the problem you’re
        trying to solve, typically through user research. Empathy is crucial to a
        human-centered design process because it allows you to set aside your own
        assumptions about the world and gain real insight into users and their needs.</p>
      <li>Define</li>
      <p>Here you accumulate the information gathered during the Empathize stage.
        You analyze your observations and synthesize them to define the core
        problems you have identified. These definitions are called
        problem statements.</p>
      <li>Ideate</li>
      <p>Now you need to generate as many ideas as possible. The knowledge
        from the first two phases make that you can start to “think outside the box”,
        look for alternative ways to view the problem and identify innovative
        solutions to the problem statement you’ve created. Brainstorming is often
        used here.
      </p>
      <li>Prototype</li>
      <p>This is an experimental phase. The aim is to identify the best possible
        solution for each problem found. You produce some inexpensive,
        dummy versions of the product to investigate the ideas you’ve generated.
        This could be a simple sketch or wireframe.</p>
      <li>Test</li>
      <p>Testing is crucial in the process. Although this is the final phase,
        design thinking is iterative: the test results are often used to redefine one
        or more findings of the previous stages. You can return to those previous stages
        to make further iterations, alterations and refinements – to find or rule
        out alternative solutions.</p>
    </ol>
